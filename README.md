# vexdb-backup
 
An archive of [VexDB](https://vexdb.io) data as JSON. VexDB stopped updating in summer 2020 due to a change in RobotEvents, so if you want to do analysis on a large amount of data, it makes sense to download the archive rather than making a bunch of requests to the VexDB API.

I've also incuded the python scripts I used to download the data, but running these is unnecessary â€“ they will take most of a day to run, make a very large number of requests to the VexDB API, and will result in the same data already in the repo.
